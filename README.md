# Tarkin's Revenge Creature Database
This is a SQL database driven web page that allows players to view and gather infomration about the various animals on the Tarkin's Revenge server. We felt it was neccasary to create this user friendly tool, due to the vast amount of updates and improvements that we've made to the creatures on Tarkin's Revenge.
